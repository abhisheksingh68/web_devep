BASIC CONCEPT OF PROGRAMMING :

How to create folder dynamically via date using cmd?
Concept 1 : A folder name can't contain, illegal character like \, /, :, *, "", ?, |, <>

If while running the command, mkdir %date% if you get an error, incorrect syntax error.
Make sure you date format does not contain illegal character \, /, ?, *, "", |, :, <>.\

Basic Story :
PHP is a our technology, and php is a server side language.

Why php is not executed on browser?

Common terms used in Web Technology :
1). Human (End User)
2). God (Server)
3). Prayer (Request)
4). Blessings (Response)

How end user makes a request?
Ans : URL (Uniform Resource Locater)

End-user will use browser as a interface/platform to make a request by using URL.

How to see request and response?
Inspect your browser,
Go to the response tab.

Some Importange Status Code :

406 not acceptable
408 request timeout
423 locked
425 too early
429 too many requests
500 internal server request
503 service unavailable
507 insufficient storage

How many types of request are there?
1). Synchronous Request
2). Asynchronous Request

1). Synchronous Request :
A request in which one event depends on other request to happen such type of request is called synchronous request. These request are blocking in nature.
Example :
JS --> window.alert()
PHP --> Form submission

2). Asynchronous Request :
A request in which one event doesn't depends on other request to happen such type of request is called asynchronous request. These request are non-blocking in nature.
Example :
1). Node.js --> window.alert()
R1 --> Waiting
R2 --> Processing --> Succeed
R3 --> Waiting
R4 --> Processing --> Succeed

2). PHP
R1 --> Waiting --> Succeed
R2 --> Waiting --> Processing --> Succeed
R3 --> Waiting --> Processing --> Succeed
R4 --> Waiting --> Processing

Getting started with Laragon :
1). While opening laragon screen you will called as laragon control panel.

Menu : All the inportants,
Settings, logs, errors, initialization, configuration related to apache, MySQL, php, will be listed here.

Important Files :
.ini - initialisation file
        It will contain all the important services, assets, resources, permissions, utilities required by any program during startup.
Examples : 
php.ini
laragon.ini
mysql.ini
etc.

.log - error file
         It will contains all the run-time errors and exceptions occured during execution of the program.
It stores the information with alert status.
1). Success
2). Info
3). Warning
4). Danger (Critical)

.cnf or .conf - configuration file
         It contains the configuration which are required during execution of the program at runtime execution.

2). www : This menu will show all the projects you will create inside C:/laragon/www.

1). Server Document Root : It contains the system path C:/laragon/www

Document root of wamp : C:/wamp/www
Document root of xampp : C:/xampp/htdocs

2). Explore Menu : It is used to open the existing projects in explorer window.

3). Share : It is used to share the resources with your team mates connected to network.

4). Project Launcher : It will launch every project in URL.

3). Quick App : In PHP, every project is know as an app.
These app can be classified [community-name] App
for example : 
1). wordpress community
     wordpress app
2). laravel community
    laravel app
3). drupal community
    drupal app
4). codeIgnitor community

How to we can make a request?
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

URL has following parts :
URL is a kind of web address to some resource located at any server.
URL can be two types :
1). Protocol Based
2). Non-Protocol Based (Uses IP Address)

URL Syntax :
[protocol-name]:<sub-domain>/<domain>/<host>:<port>/<resource-url>

Difference b/w HTTP and HTTPS :

		HTTP		HTTPS
URL		http://		https://
Security		Unsecure		Enhanced Security
Port		PORT 80		PORT 443
OSI Layer		Application Layer	Transport Layer
TLS Certificate	No		Yes
Domain Validation	Not required	Domain validation[+legal validation]
Encryption	No		Yes

TLS : Transport Layer Security
OSI : Open System Interconnection

What Is the OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s

The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.

OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standard in 1984.

OSI Model Explained: The OSI 7 Layers
7). Application Layer
The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).

6). Presentation Layer
The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.

5). Session Layer
The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.

4). Transport Layer
The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer. The transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.

3). Network Layer
The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network layer uses network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets to a destination node.

2). Data Link Layer
The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two parts—Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data.

1). Physical Layer
The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for transmission of the raw data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.

URL Syntax :
[protocol-name] : // <sub-domain>/<domain>/<host>:<port>/<resource-url>

URI Segment : In any URL which parts are separated by '/' is called as URI segment.

After port segment it's basically path to resource.

After protocol segment and before endpoint is known as domain name.
Every domain name may have a sub-domain or not but will have a port, and every domain will have an IP address too. Since anyone can't learn or remember IP address so we provide a alias name this alias name is called as domain name and this domain name has to be registered (mapped) with the IP and using DNS (Domain Name Server).

Ques : Identify protocol, port, URI segment, domain host, domain name, sub domain, resource url, extension, mime type, IP address, loopback address, local address, foriegn address and resource.
URL : http://dev.localhost/myproject/admin/p1.php

Ans : 
Protocol : http://
Port : 80 (Unsecured)
URI segment : dev.localhost/myproject/admin/p1.php
Domain host : localhost
Domain name : unavailable
Sub domain : dev
Resource URL : myproject/admin/p1.php
Extension : .php
MIME type : .php file
IP address : 127.0.0.1
Loopback address : 127.0.0.1
Foreign address : [::1]
Resource : p1.php
Local address : DESKTOP-E0AP5IL:0

Ques : What is MIME type?
Ans : MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention. When a file present on any server then we call file extension as MIME type.

How browser handles a file in the browser?
Browser checks for the MIME type supported by browser meta catalog (Dictionary).
If it exists, then it will be loaded in the memory else it will thrown as a download (this is reason why browser doesn't) give any memory allocation to the non-supported file. And will be sent to downloads.
This happens because the browser can support two types of file :
a). Renderable
b). Non-renderable

Ques : How types of files exist in browser?
Ans : Two (Renderable and Non-renderable).


1). MIME type supported : Occupie Memory
	(i) Renderable : The file which follows SGML standard or WHATWG standard.
	    SGML : HTML4
	    WHATWG : HTML5
	file:///c:/Users/Deeproshan%20Kumar/Desktop/test/index.html
	Protocol : File
	System : Local

	(ii) Non-renderable : The file which don't follow SGML or WHATWG standard will be loaded as plain text (as raw file) in that case we 		 -need to add handlers to handle such type of file.
	file:///c:/Users/Deeproshan%20Kumar/Desktop/test/index.html
	Protocol : File
	System : Local

2). MIME type not supported : Doesn't occupy memory direct download.


How to run any PHP file in the browser?
1). Add Handler PHP8 ---> Software ---> PHP Interpreter ---> Activate ---> PHP Plain Text ---> Input Parse or Compile ---> 
(meta base command style script noscript link title)

How browser handles file in the browser?
Browser checks for the MEME type supported by browser meta catalog (Dictionary).
If it exists, then it will be loaded in the memory, else it will be thrown as a download and don't give any memory allocation to the non- supported file and will be sent to the download.

This happens, because the browser can support two types of file :
a). Renderable
b). Non-renderable

Example :
index.html : Renderable
p1.txt : Non-renderable
style.css : Non-renderable
p1.jpg : Renderable
p1.png : Renderable
p1.doc : Download
p1.docx : Download
p1.xls : Download
p1.php : Non-renderable
index.exe : Download (MIME type not supported).


IF MEME Type Supported : 
i). Renderable : The file which follows SGML standard or WHATWG standard known as renderable file.
ii). Non-renderable : The file which don't follow SGML or WHATWG standard will be loaded as plain text (as raw file) in that case we need to add handlers to handle such type of file as knonw as non-renderable file.

IF MEME Type Not Supported :
Don't occupy memory and direct download.

Getting Started with PHP :
Goto - C:/laragon/www

Step 1 : Create folder
             mkdir app-2021

Step 2 : Goto inside app-2021 folder
             cd app-2021

Step 3 : How to create php file by using CMD?
             start notepad p1.php

Step 4 : How to run php file?
             php <filename.php>

There are two possible cases.
Case 1 : You will get an output.
Case 2 : php not recognized as internal or external command.

You have written the code of PHP----> Execute PHP interpreter
PHP interpreter ----> laragon
1). Set the environment variable
2). Use the laragon inbuilt terminal

How many ways we can run php programs :
1). Using Laragon Terminal
Launch laragon terminal
Goto file
Type : PHP filename.php
Output : Terminal ----> PHP CLI mode

2). Using CMD/git bash...
Goto file
Type : PHP filename.php
Output : Terminal ----> PHP CLI mode

3). Using PHP Inbuilt Server
CLI server
Goto file 
Yype : php -S localhost:<port-no> (Where, -S is command line argument)
Goto browser
Make a request
Localhost:<port-no>
Type : URL : filename.php
URL : localhost : <port-no>/file-name.php
Output : Web ----> php CLI web mode
Note : In this case you don't need to enable laragon server.
In version 5.6.2 php supports inbuilt server.
Press ctrl+c to stop running server.

4). Laragon (Server) Web Interfacce
Laragon Server : ON
PHP : Apache (ON)
MySQL : ON
Make a request using browser for http://localhost:<apache-port>

OR

Quick Open (By using cmd)
Window+R
Type cmd and hit enter.

How many ways exists to execute php code?
1). PHP CLI mode,
(i) Laragon terminal
(ii) Git bash
(iii) CMD/powershell
(iv) PHP interactive mode ---> php REPL php (>)

How to launch PHP REPL mode?
cmd:>
php -a (Where, -a is command line argument)
php > Without using opening and closing of PHP tags but ; is mandatory.

WAP a program in php interactive mode.
php > $x="Deeproshan";
php > echo $x;
Deeproshan

When we supply these arguments, the program starts executong in the same, given environment.

How to see list of all arguments?
***cmd : > php -help***
php -a : Run as interactive shell
php -n : No configuration (ini) files will be used
php -i : PHP information
php -r : Execute the code as readline
php -v : display the current version of PHP
php --version : display the current version of PHP
php -s : Run the inbuilt CLI server of PHP <@v php 5.6.2>
php -h : Run the helps
php -m : Loads the important modules initilized by php.ini

WAP in PHP to run PHP code as readline.
We will use php -r command to run the code in readline.
cmd : >php -r "echo 'My name is Deeproshan';"
My name is Deeproshan

2). PHP Web Mode
(i) PHP CLI Server (php -S <url>:<any-port-no>
(ii) Laragon Web Interface

We have only two types of program in any programming language :
1). With input
2). Without input

How to create our first program with input in web interface?
1).  Create a HTML form
2). Add any number of fields 
3). Add a submit button
4). Add form tag with action, method="GET" or method="POST"
5). Add the server side page URL which is going to handle the request at Server-side.
6). Fill the form and hit on submit button.
7). You will get a page not found 404 error. Because resource doesn't exist.
8). Create a server-side page, which can handle, client request and process data and give the response.
9). Use the super gloal variable of PHP to accept the request using $_REQUEST to handle the form fields.
10). Since, $_REQUEST is a Array, it has a key as name field attribute, in HTML form and use echo statement to display the output and after words comment it.
11). Note that, add id and name attribute on HTML forms to handle each form controls on server side.
Concept : This concept is valid for all language JSP, Python, asp.net and PHP also.
ID ---> For JavaScript or client side.
Name ---> For server side

TASKS : 
1). WAP in PHP to accept, name and display on another page.
2). WAP in PHP to take three numbers as input and display the result of sum.
3). WAP in PHP to make calculator to find +,-,*,/
4). WAP in PHP to take info of user name, email, password, mobile no. and display his/her information in next page.
5). WAP in PHP to take p,r,t and calculate SI.
6). WAP in PHP to accept length, breadth from user and calculate area, parameter of rectangle.
7). WAP in PHP to take radius as input and find area, circumference of a circle.
8). WAP in PHP to find the remainder of the given two number when a/b with modulo operator.
9). WAP in PHP to find the remainder of the given two number when a/b without modulo operator. *
10). WAP in PHP to take a and b as input and use -, /, * operators to find sum but you are not allowed to use + operator. *
Conditions:
a>b always
a>0 always (+ve)
b>0 always (+ve)
11). WAP in PHP to take input of five subjects of students, enter his marks and show the marks of each subject with overall percentage. *
